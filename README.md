## Introduction

This repository provides examples of Python code to extract data from web pages using web scraping techniques and visualize the extracted data for analysis. The code snippets utilize popular libraries such as `requests` for sending HTTP requests, `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML content, `pandas` for data manipulation, and various visualization libraries for creating informative plots.

## Getting Started

Before running the code, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using the following commands:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn autoviz
```

## Web Scraping

The provided code demonstrates web scraping by extracting data from a webpage. Here's a summary of the web scraping steps:

1. Send an HTTP GET request to the target URL using the `requests` library.
2. Parse the HTML content of the page using `BeautifulSoup`.
3. Locate and extract data from specific elements on the page using HTML tags and attributes.

## Data Visualization

The code includes examples of data visualization using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `autoviz` libraries. The visualizations provided include:

### Heatmap

The `heatmap` function creates a heatmap to visualize relationships between two variables. It normalizes and aggregates data to create a 2D histogram using a color gradient.

### Categorical Histogram

The `categorical_histogram_sorted` and `categorical_histogram` functions generate horizontal bar plots to visualize the distribution of categorical data. The functions support sorting and customization of colors and aesthetics.

## Usage

To use the provided code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Replace the sample data with your actual data or modify the code to fetch data from your desired sources.
4. Run the code snippets using a Python interpreter.
